## InterCatch raising and BMS allocations vs 2023 SA inputs

InterCatch outputs are pre-processed before inclusion in the stock assessment, so that:

  - Norwegian BMS are allocated to landings.
  - BMS from other countries are allocated to discards.

This allocations were done by external scripts that ensured consistent numbers- and weights-at-age were calculated. An
option has been added to the TAF scripts, to perform similar allocations before number and weight-at-age estimates, and
results compared to stock assessment inputs (`r figure_nums("SAinput_comp", display = "cite")`).

```{r SAinput_comp, fig.cap = cap_in}
# Figure Caption
cap_in <- figure_nums("SAinput_comp")

# Output figure
include_graphics("report/SA_inputs_Comp.png")
```
