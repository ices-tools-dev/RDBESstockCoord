This script is for a length-based assessment but with some minor modifications it can work for age.
There are some specific bits that apply only to this stock; I left them in as an example of how to adapt the script
Discussed in plenary:
 * Create output that documents the choices made wrt grouping of fleets, areas etc
 * Maybe the decisions on grouping and hierarchy for allocating / imputation can be more explicit: they could be in a table
